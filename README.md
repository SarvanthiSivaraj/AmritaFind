# AmritaFind - Lost & Found Platform for Amrita University

## Problem Statement

Amrita University operates across multiple campuses and serves thousands of students, yet there is no unified platform to manage lost and found items efficiently. As a result, students who misplace personal belongings—such as wallets, ID cards, books, or water bottles—face significant challenges. Currently, they lack a structured system to:

- **Report lost items** with clear and detailed descriptions
- **Browse or search for found items** submitted by other students
- **Communicate directly** with individuals who have located their belongings
- **Receive intelligent, AI-driven assistance** to help trace or identify items

The absence of such a coordinated solution leads to many lost items remaining unclaimed, increased administrative workload, and unnecessary inconvenience for students and staff.
